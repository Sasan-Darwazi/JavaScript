Syncronise:As its base JS Language is syncronous.
Syncronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instruction given in the program.
Each instructions waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

E.G:
console.log("First");
console.log("Second");
console.log("Third")l

Ouput:First
      Second
      Third.



Asyncronous:Asyncronous code execution allows to execute next instruction immdiately and does not block the flow beacuse of previous instructions.


E.G:console.log("first");
setTimeOut(() => console.log("Second"), 2000);
console.log("Third");
