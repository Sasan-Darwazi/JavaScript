So, let's see what the browser main components are:

>.User Inerface:This includes the address bar, the back and forward buttons, bookmarking menu, etc. In essence, this is every part of the browser display.

>.Browser Engine: it handle the interactions between the user interface and the rendering engine.

>.Rendering Engine:it's responsible for displaying the web page. The rendering engine parses the HTML and the CSS and display the parsed content on the screen

>.Networking:This component is responsible for managing network calls using standard protocols like HTTTP or FTP. it also looks after security issues associated with internet communication.
These are network calls such as XHR requests, made by using different implemention for the diffreernt platforms, wich are behind a platform-independent interface.

>.UI-backend: it's used fro drawing the core widgets such as checkboxes and windows.
it's mainly used for drawing basic widgets (window and cobmo boxes).


>.JS-Engine: this where javaScript code get executed.

>.Data-Persistence: your app might need to store all data locally. The supported types of stroage mechanisms include LocalStorage, indexDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.


Function:A function is a block of reusable codes written to perform a specific task.

Undefined: The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.

Parameter:A parameter is a named variable passed into a function.
Parameter variables are used to import argument into functions.


Anonymous Function:It is a function that does not have any name associated with it.
In ananymous function is JavaScript, we use only the function keywords without the function name.

Array: Array are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

Loose OPT ==:it just focus on the type of the value.

Strict OPT ===: it see both, type and value;

Type Conversion: it's used to change one type to another type.

We Consider Three things in our code.
.Correctness
.Design

.Style


Loops: To run something again and again.


What is Window Objects:It represents the browsers's window.
Gloabl Variables are the properties of the window objects.
.The Window Objects methods are used to retrieve the information from the browser window.
All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.

Event the document object model (DOM) is a property of the window object.
E.G:windos.document.getElementbyId("demo");

Window Size:
Two properties can be used to determine the size of the browser window.
Both properties return the sizes in pixels.

.window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window
.window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window

E.G:let w = window.innerWeight;
let h = window.innerHeight;

Window Object Methods.
1alert()
2blur(): remove the fouce on the window.
E.G:const myWin = window.open("", "", "width=250, hieght=200");
myWind.blue();

3focus();focues on the window.
E.G:const myWin = window.open("", "", "width=250, hieght=200");
myWind.focus();

4setInterval():This methods calls on a function with a specific interval.
setInterval(function, 2000);

5setTimeOut():This method calls a function after a number of millisecond. This method calls the function only once.

E.G:  const mynewTimeout = setTimeout(mynewGreeting, 5000);
function mynewGreeting() {
   document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Happy Birthday!"
}
