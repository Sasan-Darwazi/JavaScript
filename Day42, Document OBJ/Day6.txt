Day6:
Imperative Programming: is when you tell your program every single step to achieve a specific outcome. This means your program have to follow each procedure or else it will fail.


Imperative programming is based on the Statement and declarative programming is based on expression.

For example:
When you want coffee, in imperative programming you go and make the coffe by yours.
However, in declarative programming, you just call your mom to make a coffee and that is the difference between statement and expression.


E.G:
You reach for the Door.
You Opening the door.
Your tried to open the door.


Alert:The alert() method displays an alert box with a message and ok button.


Event-driven Programming: focueses on events.Eventually, the flow of program depens upon events.
Event-driven Programming is called asynchronous model.
Event-driven programming depends upon an event loop that is always listening for the new incoming events.

E.G:create button Hello, if the user clicked the button, show 'Hello';


Event Handler:The event handlers are the properties of the HTML or DOM elements, which manages how the element should react to specific event.


Few of the Event Handlers are:
.Onclick
.onload
.onmouseover
.onmouseout
.onkeypress
.onkeydown
.onkeyup


addEventListner: The addEventListener() mehtod attaches an event handler to a document.


Document:A document Object represents the HTML document that is displayed on that window.
if you want to access any element on HTML page, you always start wiht accessing the document object.

E.G:document.getElementByid(id)
.document.getElementsByTagName(name)
