Loose OPT ==:it just focus on the type of the value.

Strict OPT ===: it see both, type and value;

Type Conversion: it's used to change one type to another type.

We Consider Three things in our code.
.Correctness

Loops: To run something again and again.


What is Window Objects:It represents the browsers's window.
Gloabl Variables are the properties of the window objects.
.The Window Objects methods are used to retrieve the information from the browser window.
All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.

Event the document object model (DOM) is a property of the window object.
E.G:windos.document.getElementbyId("demo");

Window Size:
Two properties can be used to determine the size of the browser window.
Both properties return the sizes in pixels.

.window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window
.window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window

E.G:let w = window.innerWeight;
let h = window.innerHeight;

3focus();focues on the window.
E.G:const myWin = window.open("", "", "width=250, hieght=200");
myWind.focus();

4setInterval():This methods calls on a function with a specific interval.
setInterval(function, 2000);

5setTimeOut():This method calls a function after a number of millisecond. This method calls the function only once.

E.G:  const mynewTimeout = setTimeout(mynewGreeting, 5000);
